## GENERAL QUESTIONS (ALL AUDIENCES)

### What is VERIDIC?
VERIDIC is a proof-based economic infrastructure that connects real-world events to financial actions using verifiable facts rather than assumptions, predictions, or centralized trust. It is designed to support financial continuity across essential services, beginning with healthcare.

### Is VERIDIC a cryptocurrency or token project?
No. VERIDIC does not issue a native currency, speculative token, or tradable asset. Blockchain technology is used only as a neutral verification layer for anchoring cryptographic proofs.

### Does VERIDIC replace existing systems?
No. VERIDIC integrates with existing healthcare providers, payment rails, and financial institutions. It does not replace insurance, banks, hospitals, or payment networks.

## REGULATOR FAQ

### Is VERIDIC insurance?
No. VERIDIC does not provide insurance, coverage, reimbursement, underwriting, or risk pooling. It does not guarantee payment for services or cap financial exposure. Users access only their own funds under explicit rules.

### Does VERIDIC hold or custody user funds?
No. VERIDIC never takes custody of user funds. Funds remain with regulated financial institutions or user-controlled accounts. VERIDIC only authorizes and coordinates actions.

### Is VERIDIC a money transmitter?
No. VERIDIC does not move, clear, or settle funds itself. It orchestrates user-authorized actions through existing regulated payment rails.

### Does VERIDIC store personal or medical data on-chain?
No. No personal identity, medical records, diagnoses, or payment details are stored on-chain. Only cryptographic proofs of events are anchored.

### Does Proof of Presence track users?
No. Proof of Presence is event-based, not continuous. It verifies that a specific event occurred at a place and time without tracking movement, identity, or behavior.

## CONSUMER FAQ

### Is VERIDIC insurance or health coverage?
No. VERIDIC is not insurance. It does not guarantee payment or protect against all medical costs. It helps you manage, verify, and resolve healthcare expenses using your own funds.

### What happens in an emergency?
Emergency care proceeds normally. After care, CARE BRIDGE may activate to help you access your own funds and receive billing review and advocacy. Emergency care is never delayed or gated.

### Can I lose my money if VERIDIC fails?
No. Because VERIDIC does not custody funds, your money is not held by the protocol. If VERIDIC ceased operation, your funds would remain where they are held.

### Do I need crypto knowledge to use VERIDIC?
No. Users interact with familiar payment methods such as bank transfers, cards, or digital wallets. Blockchain components operate in the background.

## HEALTHCARE PROVIDER FAQ (DOCTORS, CLINICS, LABS)

### Does VERIDIC change how care is delivered?
No. VERIDIC does not affect clinical decisions, care delivery, or medical workflows.

### Does VERIDIC require system integration?
No. Providers may receive payment through existing channels. Participation does not require custom software or workflow changes.

### Does VERIDIC interfere with billing?
No. Providers bill as usual. Any post-care advocacy or negotiation occurs separately with patient authorization.

### Does VERIDIC delay payment?
No. The system is designed around prepaid or immediately authorized payment models, similar to cash-pay arrangements.

---

## HOSPITAL & EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FAQ

### Does VERIDIC affect EMTALA or emergency access?
No. Emergency care is unconditional. VERIDIC never requires payment checks, authorization, or verification before care is delivered.

### Is CARE BRIDGE involved during emergency intake?
No. CARE BRIDGE activates only after care has occurred and the patient is discharged.

### Does VERIDIC create liability for hospitals?
No. Hospitals are not required to participate, integrate, or change processes. VERIDIC operates as a patient-directed financial coordination layer.

---

## BANK & FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FAQ

### Does VERIDIC increase regulatory exposure?
VERIDIC is designed to minimize exposure by avoiding custody, pooled funds, and settlement functions. Financial institutions retain their existing roles and compliance obligations.

### How is KYC/AML handled?
Where required, identity verification is performed by regulated third-party providers. VERIDIC does not store or monetize identity data.

### Why should banks support this?
VERIDIC reduces payment friction, improves transparency, and lowers post-event disputes without introducing new custody or risk obligations.

---

## TECHNOLOGY & CRYPTO COMMUNITY FAQ

### Why use a blockchain at all?
The blockchain is used solely to anchor immutable, verifiable proofs of real-world events. It provides auditability without central trust or data aggregation.

### Are NFTs speculative assets in VERIDIC?
No. NFTs function only as rights containers representing prepaid entitlements or access. They do not confer ownership, profit rights, or governance.

### Is there a roadmap to a token?
No. VERIDIC is not designed around a token economy.

---

## FUTURE & EXPANSION FAQ

### Will VERIDIC expand beyond healthcare?
Potentially. The architecture supports additional domains such as education, workforce verification, and public benefits. These engines are defined but inactive.

### Is there a UBI or income component?
A future income rights engine is conceptually defined but not active. It makes no promises of distribution or funding.

## FINAL CLARIFICATION

VERIDIC is infrastructure, not a financial product.  
It verifies events, enforces rules, and coordinates execution using existing systems.  
It does not eliminate risk, guarantee outcomes, or replace institutions.

For detailed design, boundaries, and safeguards, refer to the VERIDIC whitepaper.
