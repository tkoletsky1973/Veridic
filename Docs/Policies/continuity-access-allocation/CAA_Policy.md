# VERIDIC — Continuity Access Allocation (CAA)
## Policy Specification (Non-Custodial, Non-Insurance)

**Version:** v0.1  
**Status:** Draft — Policy Layer (Pre-Implementation)  
**Scope:** Healthcare Vertical Only

---

## 1. Purpose

The **Continuity Access Allocation (CAA)** is a limited, policy-bound onboarding allocation
designed to reduce **financial disruption** associated with verified healthcare events.

CAA is **not**:
- insurance
- income
- a cash grant
- a guarantee of payment
- a pooled or shared benefit

CAA functions exclusively as **prepaid, non-cash access to eligible healthcare services**
under explicit and enforceable constraints.

---

## 2. Classification Boundaries

CAA is explicitly classified as:
- non-insurance
- non-custodial
- non-income
- non-security
- non-transferable by default

CAA does not assume risk, price risk, pool risk, or guarantee outcomes.
These boundaries are structural and non-optional.

---

## 3. Allocation Structure (Hybrid Model)

### 3.1 Universal Baseline

All verified users receive a **minimum allocation of $500** in Continuity Access Allocation
upon enrollment.

This baseline:
- ensures universal inclusion
- avoids exclusion or gatekeeping optics
- establishes continuity without creating dependency or expectation of protection

---

### 3.2 Income-Scaled Allocation (Off-Chain)

Beyond the universal baseline, CAA may be increased based on **income band classification**.
Income scaling is designed to improve equity **without introducing welfare, surveillance,
or redistribution dynamics**.

Income determination operates as follows:
- Users self-attest to an income range
- Verification may occur via a third-party provider or employer confirmation
- VERIDIC does **not** store raw income data
- Only a coarse income band indicator may be retained for audit and policy enforcement

The **maximum CAA allocation is capped at $3,500**, regardless of income.
Higher-income users may receive only the baseline allocation, while lower-income users
may qualify for larger allocations within the cap.

Income scaling is:
- opt-in
- non-continuous
- non-retroactive
- non-public
- non-transferable

---

### 3.3 User-Funded and Employer-Negotiated Additions

CAA may be increased through:
- user-funded prepaid deposits
- employer-sponsored contributions
- institutional or philanthropic programs

All additions:
- remain segregated by user
- follow the same usage constraints as baseline CAA
- are non-cash and non-withdrawable
- do not create pooled exposure or cross-user subsidy

---

## 4. Activation & Anti-Gaming Controls

CAA is **issued at enrollment** but activates only after one of the following occurs:
- the first verified healthcare event
- completion of a 90–180 day seasoning period
- an initial user-funded deposit

This prevents opportunistic enrollment and limits abuse.

---

## 5. Eligible and Prohibited Uses

CAA may be applied only to verified healthcare services, including:
- routine care
- urgent care
- mental health services
- dental services
- vision services
- laboratory and diagnostic services
- post-event emergency continuity via CARE BRIDGE

CAA may **not** be used for:
- elective surgery
- cosmetic procedures
- long-term inpatient care
- catastrophic or unbounded treatment
- cash withdrawal or cash-equivalent use

---

## 6. Expiration

Unused CAA expires after **12–24 months**, configurable by policy profile.
Expired allocations do not roll over and cannot be reclaimed.

---

## 7. Governance & Revocation

CAA may be reduced or revoked only in cases of:
- fraud
- misrepresentation
- policy violation

All revocations are:
- rule-based
- auditable
- non-discretionary

---

## 8. Language Controls (Mandatory)

The following language **must** be used consistently.

**Permitted terms**
- prepaid access
- continuity buffer
- rights allocation
- policy-bound entitlement
- service-limited credit

**Prohibited terms**
- insurance
- coverage
- insured
- guaranteed / guarantee
- grant (cash)
- income
- free money
- safety net (as protection)

---

## 9. Non-Substitution Clause

CAA does **not** replace insurance, public benefits, employer plans, or legally required
coverage. It operates strictly as a **supplemental continuity layer**.

---

## 10. Failure Behavior

If funds are insufficient or systems are unavailable:
- CAA degrades to **advocacy and coordination only**
- user-owned funds remain unaffected
