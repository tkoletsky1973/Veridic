# Continuity Access Allocation (CAA)

The Continuity Access Allocation (CAA) is a limited, policy-bound onboarding mechanism
designed to reduce post-event financial disruption in healthcare contexts.

CAA is not:
- insurance
- income
- a cash grant
- a financial product
- a replacement for coverage or public benefits

This folder contains:
- `CAA_POLICY.yaml` — formal policy specification
- `CAA_RISK_AND_MITIGATION.yaml` — risk and hostile-review registry

These files define intent, constraints, and safeguards prior to implementation.
