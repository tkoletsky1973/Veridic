# VERIDIC — Continuity Access Allocation (CAA)
## Hostile & Extreme Hostility Risk Mitigation Registry

**Version:** v0.2  
**Purpose:** Preempt neutral, hostile, and extreme-hostility objections from regulators,
political actors, financial institutions, advocacy groups, and media.

This document assumes bad faith interpretation and addresses it directly.

---

## Concern 1: “This is free money, welfare, or UBI”

### Hostile Framing
“You’re giving people money just for signing up. This is welfare disguised as tech.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is an unapproved income distribution scheme designed to bypass welfare law and
create dependency.”

### Mitigations
- CAA is non-cash and non-withdrawable
- CAA is service-bound and expires unused
- No unconditional access; activation is event- or time-based
- No transferability, resale, or cash equivalence
- No recurring distribution or entitlement

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA cannot be spent freely, cannot be saved as wealth, and cannot function as income.

**Residual Risk:** Low

---

## Concern 2: “This is insurance in disguise”

### Hostile Framing
“You’re covering medical costs without calling it insurance.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is illegal shadow insurance designed to evade healthcare regulation.”

### Mitigations
- No risk pooling of any kind
- No premiums, underwriting, or actuarial pricing
- No coverage language permitted
- No guarantee of payment or affordability
- CARE BRIDGE activates strictly after care
- No catastrophic or unbounded coverage

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA cannot assume, price, or spread risk and therefore cannot operate as insurance.

**Residual Risk:** Low (language discipline required)

---

## Concern 3: “Users will think they are protected or covered”

### Hostile Framing
“You’re misleading people into thinking they’re safe in emergencies.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This system creates false confidence that will cause harm or delayed care.”

### Mitigations
- Mandatory onboarding acknowledgment stating:
  “CAA is not insurance, coverage, or a guarantee of payment”
- Prohibited UI terms: insured, covered, guaranteed, protected
- Emergency care proceeds regardless of CAA
- CARE BRIDGE framed explicitly as post-event continuity and advocacy

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA cannot block, delay, or authorize care under any circumstance.

**Residual Risk:** Moderate (human perception, not system design)

---

## Concern 4: “This favors the wealthy and exploits the poor”

### Hostile Framing
“This benefits people who already have money.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is a regressive system that monetizes poverty under the guise of access.”

### Mitigations
- Universal minimum allocation for all users
- Income-scaled caps favoring lower-income users
- Employer, sponsor, and institutional funding pathways
- No exclusion criteria based on income, employment, or status
- No extraction, fees, or interest tied to CAA

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA reduces disparity by increasing access ceilings for lower-income users without
redistribution or debt.

**Residual Risk:** Moderate (political optics)

---

## Concern 5: “This is financially unsustainable or deceptive”

### Hostile Framing
“This will collapse or strand users when funding dries up.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is a bait-and-switch scheme using temporary subsidies to trap users.”

### Mitigations
- VERIDIC does not self-fund CAA from pooled user funds
- All allocations are capped, finite, and sponsor-backed
- No open-ended liabilities
- No dependency on future inflows
- If funding ceases, CAA simply stops issuing — nothing breaks

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA failure does not strand funds, block care, or create obligations.

**Residual Risk:** Low

---

## Concern 6: “This is a security, investment, or financial product”

### Hostile Framing
“You’re issuing something of value that looks like an investment.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is an unregistered security wrapped in healthcare language.”

### Mitigations
- No expectation of profit
- No appreciation mechanism
- No secondary market by default
- No ownership, governance, or revenue rights
- Consumptive utility only
- Value realized solely through service use

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA has no upside, no yield, and no market dynamics.

**Residual Risk:** Low

---

## Concern 7: “Income verification creates surveillance or discrimination”

### Hostile Framing
“You’re collecting sensitive financial data.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is a profiling system that will be abused or weaponized.”

### Mitigations
- One-time verification only
- Third-party or employer attestations
- No raw income stored by VERIDIC
- No continuous monitoring
- No on-chain personal or financial data

### Structural Kill Switch
Income is abstracted to coarse bands and discarded after classification.

**Residual Risk:** Low

---

## Concern 8: “This will be gamed, abused, or fraudulently exploited”

### Hostile Framing
“People will sign up just to drain the benefit.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This invites organized fraud and exploitation.”

### Mitigations
- Deferred activation (event or seasoning)
- Proof of Presence required for qualifying events
- Expiration windows
- Rule-based revocation for fraud
- Rate limits and off-chain anomaly detection

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA cannot be immediately monetized or rapidly extracted.

**Residual Risk:** Low–Moderate

---

## Concern 9: “This replaces insurance, Medicaid, or public benefits”

### Hostile Framing
“You’re undermining public systems.”

### Extreme Hostility Framing
“This is privatized shadow healthcare designed to hollow out public safety nets.”

### Mitigations
- Explicit non-substitution clause
- No claims adjudication
- No benefit coordination
- No eligibility replacement
- Supplemental-only positioning enforced in policy and UI

### Structural Kill Switch
CAA cannot replace coverage because it does not provide coverage.

**Residual Risk:** Low

---

## META: When Hostility Escalates Beyond Policy

### If Accusations Persist Despite Mitigations
- Freeze scope expansion
- Publish this registry publicly
- Invite third-party legal and regulatory review
- Reiterate non-insurance, non-income constraints
- Do not argue intent — point to structural impossibility

---

## Final Assessment

CAA is vulnerable only to **mischaracterization**, not misuse.

At extreme hostility levels, the correct response is not defense —
it is demonstrating that the system **cannot do what it is accused of doing**.

That is the design.
