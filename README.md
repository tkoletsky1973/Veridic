# VERIDIC

**VERIDIC** is a proof-based economic infrastructure that connects real-world events to financial outcomes using verifiable facts rather than assumptions, speculation, or centralized trust.

The system enables financial continuity across essential services—starting with healthcare—without insurance, pooled risk, surveillance, or proprietary payment networks.

## What VERIDIC Is

VERIDIC is **infrastructure**, not a product or marketplace.

It provides:
- A neutral truth layer for anchoring verifiable real-world events
- A capital engine for managing user-owned prepaid value under explicit policy rules
- Privacy-preserving verification of presence and eligibility
- Rail-agnostic settlement across existing payment systems
- Programmable rights containers for enforceable, non-speculative entitlements

VERIDIC integrates with existing institutions rather than replacing them.

---

## What VERIDIC Is Not

VERIDIC is **not**:
- Insurance or health coverage
- An investment product or yield platform
- A money transmitter or custodian
- A surveillance or identity system
- A speculative token economy

These boundaries are structural and intentional.

## Initial Focus: Healthcare

Healthcare is the first application domain because it exposes the failures of assumption-based systems most clearly.

The healthcare vertical supports:
- Routine care (urgent care, DPC, concierge care)
- Mental health services
- Dental and vision care
- Labs, diagnostics, and telehealth
- Emergency and acute-care financial continuity via **CARE BRIDGE**

VERIDIC does not replace clinical care, insurance, or provider workflows.  
It operates as a **financial continuity and verification layer** alongside them.

## CARE BRIDGE (Emergency Continuity)

CARE BRIDGE addresses the financial chaos that follows emergency care.

It provides:
- Event-verified emergency liquidity access to user-owned funds
- Post-care billing review and negotiation via licensed advocacy
- Structured financial resolution without interfering with hospitals

CARE BRIDGE does **not** guarantee payment, pool risk, or insure outcomes.

## Core Components

- **Veridic Chain** — Anchors cryptographic proofs of real-world events  
- **Universal Value Engine (UVE)** — Manages prepaid value under policy constraints  
- **Rights Containers** — Programmable, non-speculative entitlements (NFT-based)  
- **Proof of Presence (PoP)** — Privacy-preserving event verification  
- **Settlement Layer** — Non-custodial integration with existing payment rails  

---

## Privacy and Security

VERIDIC is built on data minimization:
- No medical records on-chain
- No identity or behavioral tracking
- No pooled financial data
- Verification without surveillance

Only cryptographic proofs are anchored publicly.

## Project Status

- Whitepaper: complete (draft v0.1)
- Scope: healthcare-first, infrastructure-focused
- Future engines: defined but inactive (education, workforce, public benefits, future income rights)

Expansion is gated by real-world validation and regulatory clarity.
